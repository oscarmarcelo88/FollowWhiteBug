        To open the white bug chest you need the five-number combination for the lock. You can do it in teams or by yourself. <br>
        To get the rest of the numbers you need to solve some puzzles, let’s start with a riddle: <br>
        <br>
        There's a booth where Brains is the star,<br>
        <s>Yet</s> Jet, all its wonders are on par,<br>
        Just ask the question, don't be shy,<br>
        "where is the white bug?” and you will find the light,<br>
    </p>
