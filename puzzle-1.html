        To open the white bug chest you need the five number combination for the lock. <br>
        The first number is: 3#### <br>
        To get the rest of the numbers you need to solve some puzzles, letâ€™s start with a riddle: <br>
        <br>
        There's a booth where water is the star,<br>
        And all its wonders are on par,<br>
        Just ask the question, don't be shy or smug,<br>
        "Where is the white bug?"<br>
    </p>
